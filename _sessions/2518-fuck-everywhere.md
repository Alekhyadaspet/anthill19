F.U.C.K. München - FNTI* und Computer Kram - Frauen (frauen/nicht-binär/trans*/inter —> women/non-binary/trans*/inter*) Und (And) Computer Kram (Stuff)

The German hacker community is very active yet very much dominated by cis men. Inspired by the women* only hackerspace “Heart of Code” we started a regular meetup (exclusively) for women, non-binary, trans* and inter* people in Munich this year. Since then people in 6 (and counting) other cities started their own initiative under that label.

While differing in their concepts all of them are spaces where people come together for hacking, making, exchanging experiences, mentoring, learning and much more. Overwhelmed with the positive response our next goal is to build a community/network and share knowledge.

In this session I'll talk about our motivations, approaches and hope to have a discussion about it with those who are interested.
