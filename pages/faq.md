### Is this a paid event?

There is no fee for anything at all. We’d love it if your friends can join, so don’t hesitate to bring them with you. Simply register for the event, come on in. Do spread the word and let more people know about Anthillhacks.

### What about food?

There will be a kitchen at the camp where food will be made for the people at the camp. Kitchen takes contributions on a sliding scale. The village on the hill - about 200 meters also have a few street side "cafes". Ofcourse, you can cook your own - camping style (no plastic thrash please). *Please volunteer for the kitchen and cleanup.*

### What about accommodation?

There are a few rooms and a number of tents that can be reserved.

...my projects and tools?
: Oh yes, you should!  Bring your whole project group and take a code retreat or
  whatever needs to be done --- and get fruitful exchanges with the other
  participants.  Please let us know what things you want to bring, so that we
  can arrange appropriate space for you.

  We have some to share, but never enough.

  conference days, priority is given to curated sessions, but you may be able to
  schedule yourself into unused spaces.
