Anteras of Devarayanadurga and Iruway (iruway.janastu.org) farms at its foothills - about 75 KM NW of Bangalore and 15KM East of Tumkur, India.

Devarayanadurga is a living fort towm from the Vijayanagara Empire period and is picturesque where these hills become a part of the 360 degree hills range, the valley now has a 4 villages and lots of forest and trekking areas. The rocks are majestic.

There is a Yatri Nivas - a travellers lodge and other smaller "guest houses" built by the devotees of the temple on the hill. Anteras is a stepped terras that is owned by a buffalo herder where we pitch our tents.

We will set up a kitchen in this area too.

Some of the Anthillhacks sessions and activities will be at the iruWay farm at the west side foothills of Devarayanadurga. This is reachable by a 30 min trek from the hill or a 4 km ride by road.
